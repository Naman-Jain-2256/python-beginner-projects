A simple and beginner-friendly Python CLI tool to print the **Fibonacci sequence** up to a number of terms specified by the user. This project is a great way to practice loops, input handling, exception management, and sequence generation.

## 🧠 What Is the Fibonacci Sequence?


The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.  
The sequence starts like this:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

---

## 💻 How It Works

- Prompts the user to enter the number of terms.
- Validates the input (positive integers only).
- Generates and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to that number of terms.

---

## 📦 Example Output

```bash
Enter the number of terms: 7
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
- Save the file as fibonacci-sequence.py (or use the existing filename).
- Run the script in your terminal:
```bash
python fibonacci-sequence.py
```

## 📚 Concepts Used
- try-except for error handling
- Conditionals (if)
- Loops (for)
- List and string operations
